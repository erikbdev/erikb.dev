/// A high-performance double-buffered terminal renderer.
///
/// `VTRenderer` implements an efficient rendering system that minimizes
/// terminal output through damage-based updates and intelligent optimization.
/// The renderer uses double buffering to track changes between frames and
/// only redraws modified areas.
///
/// ## Architecture
///
/// The renderer maintains two buffers:
/// - **Back buffer**: Where your application draws new content
/// - **Front buffer**: The current displayed state
///
/// During `present()`, the renderer compares buffers to identify changes
/// (damage) and sends only the necessary updates to the terminal.
///
/// ## Performance Features
///
/// - **Damage-based rendering**: Only updates changed areas
/// - **Run-length encoding**: Optimizes repeated character output
/// - **Cursor optimization**: Minimizes cursor movement commands
/// - **Synchronized updates**: Uses terminal synchronization for flicker-free rendering
/// - **SGR state tracking**: Minimizes style change commands
///
/// ## Usage Example
///
/// ```swift
/// let renderer = try await VTRenderer(mode: .raw)
///
/// // Render loop with automatic frame rate control
/// try await renderer.rendering(fps: 60) { buffer in
///   // Draw your content to the buffer
///   buffer.write(string: "Hello, World!", at: VTPosition(row: 1, column: 1))
///   buffer.fill(rect: Rect(x: 0, y: 10, width: 20, height: 5),
///               with: "█", style: .default)
/// }
/// ```

  /// Current rendering performance statistics.
  ///
  /// Provides real-time performance metrics when profiling is enabled
  /// through the `rendering(fps:_:)` method. Returns zero values when
  /// profiling is not active.
  ///
  /// ## Metrics Available
  /// - **FPS**: Current, average, minimum, and maximum frame rates
  /// - **Frame time**: Current and average frame rendering duration
  /// - **Frame counts**: Total rendered and dropped frame counts
  ///
  /// ## Usage Example
  /// ```swift
  /// let stats = renderer.statistics
  /// print("FPS: \(stats.fps.current), Frame time: \(stats.frametime.current)")
  /// ```
  // public nonisolated var statistics: FrameStatistics {
  //   profiler?.statistics

  /// Renders damage spans to the terminal with optimized output.
  ///
  /// This is the core rendering method that converts buffer differences
  /// into efficient terminal commands. It performs several optimizations:
  ///
  /// - **Synchronized updates**: Prevents flicker during complex updates
  /// - **Cursor optimization**: Minimizes cursor movement by leveraging auto-wrap
  /// - **SGR state tracking**: Reduces style change commands
  /// - **Run-length encoding**: Optimizes repeated character sequences
  ///
  /// The method uses terminal synchronization to ensure atomic updates
  /// and maintains minimal cursor movement for optimal performance.

  /// 3. Swaps buffers to prepare for the next frame

  ///

  /// await renderer.present()
  ///
  /// // Back buffer is now ready for next frame
  /// renderer.back.clear()

  /// Runs an automatic rendering loop with frame rate control and profiling.
  ///
  /// This method provides a complete rendering solution with automatic
  /// frame rate control, performance profiling, and buffer management.
  /// Your render callback is called at the specified frame rate, and
  /// the renderer handles all timing and optimization automatically.
  ///
  /// ## Features
  /// - **Frame rate control**: Maintains consistent timing
  /// - **Performance profiling**: Tracks FPS and frame time metrics
  /// - **Automatic buffer management**: Handles present and clear operations
  /// - **Structured concurrency**: Properly manages the rendering task
  ///
  /// ## Parameters
  /// - fps: Target frame rate (frames per second)
  /// - render: Callback that draws content to the back buffer
  ///
  /// ## Usage Example
  /// ```swift
  /// try await renderer.rendering(fps: 60) { buffer in
  ///   // Draw your application content
  ///   drawUI(&buffer)
  ///   drawGame(&buffer)
  /// }
  /// ```
  ///
  /// ## Error Handling
  /// The method propagates any errors thrown by your render callback
  /// and properly cleans up the rendering loop. The rendering task
  /// is automatically cancelled when the method exits.
  ///
  /// ## Performance Monitoring
  /// While this method runs, use the `statistics` property to monitor
  /// rendering performance and detect frame drops or timing issues.
